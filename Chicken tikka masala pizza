1 small red onion
thinly sliced
1 tbsp red wine vinegar
4 garlic and coriander naan breads
4 chicken breasts
cut into strips
2 green pepper
sliced
2-3 tbsp tikka masala curry paste
150ml natural yogurt
1 green chilli
thinly sliced
1 small pack coriander
leaves torn
few dollops of mango chutney
to serve

Method
step 1
Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Toss the red onion with the red wine vinegar and a good pinch of salt and set aside (the vinegar will soften the onion slightly,
which is a blessing as no one wants completely raw onion on pizza).

step 2
Put the naan breads on a baking tray, sprinkle over a little water, then put in the oven for 2 mins to heat up.
Meanwhile, put the chicken and peppers in a frying pan with the curry paste, toss together, then fry over a high heat for 6-8 mins until cooked.

step 3
Take the naans out the oven, spread each one with yogurt, then top with the chicken, red onion, green chilli, coriander and mango chutney.
